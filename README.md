# Corrily SDK integration examples

**Corrily integration involves two main tasks:**
1. Display prices sourced from Corrily on your pricing page.
2. Connect Corrily to your subscription management platform to feed revenue events for analytics.

ðŸ‘‰ This repository provides examples for the first task,
while documentation for the second can be found in Corrily's [integration docs](https://docs.corrily.com/integrations/01_launch-checklist). 

**There are two common methods to display Corrily prices:**
1. Use Corrily's no-code [Paywall Builder](https://docs.corrily.com/paywall-builder/configure) for full control over your pricing page's design and content.
2. Integrate [Corrily API](https://docs.corrily.com/api-reference/calculate-price) to power the content on your existing pricing page without altering your unique design.


## Corrily API Integration
Retrieve user-specific prices by making API requests to Corrily from your back-end.

1. Stripe Golang example ([link](api-integration/stripe-golang))


## Corrily Paywalls Integration (React SDK)
